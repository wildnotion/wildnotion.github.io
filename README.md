SNHU CS-499 C-1

Original CS360 Project: Not functional, with many comments simply stating "FIXME" or "Please add the correct logic."

Update_01: A simple, yet functional two-tier SQLite database with login and cache creation.
           Addition of comments on algorithms, debug logs for tracking, and better format consistency. 
TODO: Implementation of the inventory, the third tier of the database, connecting items to each cache.
      Adding images for each cache and each item while updating each layout's user interface (UI).

Informal Code Review: https://youtu.be/Qr_exohsXqc
           The TODO's and additional code edits performed from Update_01 on were informed by a code review I performed.
           Breaking down the design and logic from the non-functioning original, I created a functional update to build upon.
           The review starts with coverage on the original before moving onto the updated build.
                
Update_02: A functional three-tier SQLite database with login, cache creation, and adding items to an inventory.
           Implementation of a grid image selection for choosing cache and item images.
           Continued addition of comments on algorithms, debug logs for tracking, and better format consistency. 
TODO: Addition of an encryption manager to secure all stored data.
      Addition of a permissions activity to allow access of GPS sensor.
      Addition of a GPS manager class to obtain GPS coordinates from sensor.
